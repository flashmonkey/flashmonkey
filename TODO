MultiplayerVideo
--------------------------------
Write the images to the new container - remove the need for a published stream.
Needs a client application that can subscribe to the stream and seek to the correct time in the stream.
Add a simulation that demonstrates the capability - has to be something that flash would choke on to show the point.
Hook into the multiplayer plugin. So client sends messages that update the simulation. 
Accept user input, object selection etc.
