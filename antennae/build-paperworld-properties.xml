        Instead of modifying properties in this file it is recommended that:

        1) Make all modification in a build-user.properties file in the directory above
           This is handy for developer specific settings

        2) Create an override file that build-common-imports.xml includes ahead
           of the standard build-common-properties.

        Either of these approaches will allow updating the Antennae templates without
        requiring the merge of localized changes into the distributed files.
