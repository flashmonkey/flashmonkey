Welcome to flashmonkey's presentation at LFPUG - November '09

By the time you're reading this you should be able to see the video of the presentation at www.lfpug.com

All the source for the binaries in this distribution are available from the GIT repository at http://github.com/flashmonkey/flashmonkey

In this file you should find:

/eclipse_projects

A directory containing the eclipse projects for the simple applications created using the Red5 Eclipse Plugin during the first half of the presentation.

/demos

The client and server applications for the demos shown in the second half of the presentation.

Beware: You'll need to have some things installed on your system to run these demos… if you're having trouble feel free to contact me at trevor@flashmonkey.org and ask.

HelloGestureVideoControl/HelloMouseGesturesClient

This is an AIR app that shows the mouse gesture recognition in action. Just run the webapp in a Red5 installation and launch the air app and start drawing gestures.

HelloSpeechRecognition/HelloSpeechRecognitionClient

You'll need to have ffmpeg installed on the machine the webapp is running on. Check http://ffmpeg.org/ for details of how to do that. once you're running it'll recognize numbers between 0 and 9.

MultiplayerVideoBaseGame/MultiplayerVideoBaseGameClient

Run the webapp in a Red5 installation and you should see a java window pop up with the simulation running. When you open the swf file it'll connect to red5 running on localhost and try to grab the webcam - so make sure you've got one active and it should all be fine.
